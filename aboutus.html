<h1 style="font-style:normal; font-weight:lighter;">Who are 'SEEDS'? </h1>
<blockquote>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000; font-size:"6"">Seeds aims to develop young Muslim women to discover their potential; spiritually, academically and socially!
We certainly do not have a shortage of Muslims living in this area, in fact, according to the last census there are 58, 036 Muslims live in Brent.

As people who have been bought up in this area, we have been well aware that there is a desperate shortage of activities or programmes, which specifically target Muslim girls. Growing up, we lacked role models, people who could relate to the issues we were facing and people who could help us understand the importance of academic and community based achievements.

SEEDS is our way of doing something about it! We organised a holistic programme in a youth club setting for young girls to grow and develop and find themselves.

<h1><h1 align="center">What is our programme? </h1>

<ol>
<li><b>Monthly Support Sessions</b> during which we cover topics we feel will be the key to unlocking their potential. These sessions cover the following:</li>
<li><b>Mentoring</b> where we aim to match our young people with mentors in their aspiring fields.</li>
<li><b>Trips</b> to build an affective bond between our members, we plan day trips at least twice a year.</li>
<li><b>Practical activities</b> - the girls have previously volunteered at soup kitchens, senior peoples homes and organised picnics for refugees.</li>
</ol>

<h1><h1 align="center">History and Progress</h1>

<p>In August 2016 we launched our organisation with an event in Willesden Green to introduce our work and ambitions to the community. We had some awesome speakers and it was the perfect introduction to the community.
  Since then, slowly but surely, SEEDS has continued to grow. Our first session had two participants, but over the years that number grew and so did our volunteers team.

<div class="images">
<div class="row">
  <div class="first-image col-xs-4">
    <img  style="height: 250px;"src="Asmaa.jpg">
    <p><b>Asmaa</b> is a professional Engineer specialising in system optimisation. But despite
    her busy schedule, she also volunteers for another organisation in London which
    provides tuition to teenage Muslims. She brings her brilliant mind and incredibly kind
    character to each session, paying attention to every student and making sure that no
   one is left out.</p>
 </div>

<div class="second-image col-xs-4">
  <img  src="Saba.jpg">
   <p><b>Saba</b> is a teacher at a local girls secondary school so she is certainly no stranger
   to teenagers! She has a background education in History and extensive experience
   teaching Islamic seerah. Saba often brings her skills and knowledge to SEEDS,
   running sessions about the stories of the sahaba and the Islamic caliphate.</p>
</div>

<div class="third-image col-xs-4">
   <img  style="height: 250px;"src="Hafsa.jpg">
    <p><b>Hafsa</b> has years of experience teaching teenagers and is currently working with a charity for young carers. Alongside this, she has a background in
    Psychology and so maybe thatâ€™s why she loves a good discussion, often encouraging the girls to speak their mind and share their opinions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="otherimages">
<div class="fourth-image col-xs-4">
  <img src="Sabiha.jpg">
  <p><b>Sabiha</b> is a newly qualified doctor and currently works in a hospital. It was awesome when she bought her blood pressure monitor and stethoscope into a
   session for the girls to use, as she talked about different career paths in medicine. But the best thing about Sabiha is the beaming positivity she brings to every session,
   when most might loose their patience, Sabiha is there, smiling and always always super cool..</p>
</div>

<div class="fifth-image col-xs-4">
  <img style="height: 250px;"src="Khadijah.jpg">
  <p><b>Khadijah</b> is a law graduate with a background in Human Rights. It is probably those experience which means Khadijah often emphasises the importance
   of giving back to the community, encouraging the girls to set long term goals and volunteer. Khadijah is very ambitious and her lovely character shines throughout the
   organisation.</p>
